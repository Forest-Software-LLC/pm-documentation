# Forest CLI Commands

The Forest CLI provides commands to help you manage your Forest projects and packages.

## Commands


### `forest init`

Initializes a new package in the current directory. This creates a `forest.json` file with metadata such as name, version, and description.

```bash
forest init

> Platform : <select your platform>

Created forest.json
```

### `forest install <package-name>`
Installs a package from Forest. Downloads the package and its dependencies into your project’s packages directory.

Alias: `forest i <package-name>`

### `forest uninstall <package-name>`

Uninstalls a package from your project. Removes the package and its dependencies from your project’s packages directory.

Alias: `forest remove <package-name>`

### `forest publish`

Publishes your package to Forest. Uploads the package and its metadata to the Forest registry, making it available for others to install.

### `forest login`
Logs in to your Forest account. Prompts for username and password, then stores your authentication token locally.

The Forest CLI supports two-factor authentication (2FA). If enabled, you’ll be prompted for a 2FA code after entering your credentials.

```bash
forest login

> Username: your-username
> Password: ********
> 2FA Code: 123456
Logged in as your-username
```

### `forest logout`
Logs out of your Forest account and removes the local authentication token.

### `forest whoami`

Displays the currently logged-in user for the active Forest account.
