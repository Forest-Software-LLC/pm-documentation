# Forest CLI Commands

The Forest CLI provides a variety of commands to help you manage your Forest projects.

## Commands


### `forest init`

Initializes a new Forest package in the current directory. This command creates a `forest.json` file that contains metadata about your package, such as its name, version, and description.

```bash
forest init

> Platform : <select your platform>

Created forest.json
```

### `forest install <package-name>`
Installs a package from the Forest Package Manager. This command downloads the package and its dependencies and adds them to your project's `packages` directory.

Alias: `forest i <package-name>`

### `forest uninstall <package-name>`

Uninstalls a package from your project. This command removes the package and its dependencies from your project's `packages` directory.

Alias: `forest remove <package-name>`

### `forest publish`

Publishes your package to the Forest Package Manager. This command uploads your package and its metadata to the Forest PM registry, making it available for others to install and use.

### `forest login`
Logs in to your Forest PM account. This command prompts you for your username and password and stores your authentication token locally.

The Forest CLI has built-in support for two-factor authentication (2FA). If your account has 2FA enabled, you'll be prompted to enter your 2FA code after entering your username and password.

```bash
forest login

> Username: your-username
> Password: ********
> 2FA Code: 123456
Logged in as your-username
```

### `forest logout`
Logs out of your Forest PM account. This command removes your authentication token from your local machine.

### `forest whoami`

Displays the currently logged-in user. This command shows your username for the Forest PM account.
