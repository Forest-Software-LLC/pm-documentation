## Notification of Claimed Infringement

   If you believe your copyrighted work has been infringed, please submit a written notice to our Designated Agent that includes all elements required under 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3);
   2a. A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or authorized representative.
   2b. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.
   2c. Identification of the allegedly infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to locate it. The easiest way to do this is by providing web addresses (URLs) leading directly to the allegedly infringing content.
   2d. Your contact information including full name, current address, and an active telephone number and email address.
   2e. A statement that you have a good-faith belief the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
   2f. A statement that the information in the notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
   Upon receipt of a proper claim of copyright infringement as identified above, we will work to expeditiously remove or disable access to the claimed infringing material.

## Counter-Notification

   If you believe your content was removed or disabled in error, you may submit a counter-notice to our Designated Agent. The following information is required under 17 U.S.C. §512(g)(3) to be deemed a proper counter-notification (submitted to our Designated Agent identified above);
   3a. Your physical or electronic signature.
   3b. Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and its original location.
   3c. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.
   3d. Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or if outside the U.S., that you consent to jurisdiction in the federal courts located in Travis County, Texas), and that you will accept service of process from the person who submitted the original notice.

## Post-Counter-Notification Process

   Upon receipt of a proper counter-notice, we will supply the person who provided the original claim of copyright infringement with a copy of the counter-notice, and we will replace the removed content or cease disabling access to the content not less than 10 business days, and not more than 14 business days, UNLESS our Designated Agent (identified above) first receives notice from the person who provided the original claim of copyright infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the individual (or entity) in control of the alleged infringing content, from engaging in infringing activity related to the content located on our website.

## Notice–Takedown–Putback Process

    ##### Notice Received (Day 0)
    When Forest receives a valid DMCA notice, the identified content is promptly **disabled or removed**. Forest then notifies the user who posted or uploaded the content, providing them a copy of the notice and instructions on how to submit a counter-notification.

    ##### Takedown Period (Up to 30 Days)
    The removed content remains in an **inactive state** — not publicly visible, excluded from search results and user profiles — while Forest awaits either:
        * a counter-notification from the user; or
        * confirmation that the complainant has filed a court action.
        If **no counter-notification** is received within 30 days, the content is permanently deleted per the Retention Policy below.

    ##### Counter-Notification (If Submitted)
    If a proper counter-notification is received, Forest forwards it to the original complainant within a reasonable time (typically 1–2 business days).

    ##### Put-Back Window (10–14 Business Days)
    Unless the complainant notifies Forest within **10 business days** that they have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to restrain the alleged infringement, Forest will **restore or re-enable** the content between 10 and 14 business days after forwarding the counter-notice.

    ##### Case Closure
        * If a lawsuit is filed and Forest receives evidence of it within the 10-day window, the content remains disabled pending court resolution.
        * If no such notice is received, Forest restores the material and considers the matter closed.

    ##### Retention Policy
        * **Inactive status:** Content removed in response to a DMCA notice will remain disabled, hidden from public view, and excluded from search results and user profiles until the DMCA process is fully resolved.
        * **Retention period:** Removed content will be retained in our systems for 30 days from the date of removal. If the dispute is not resolved or no counter-notice is filed within that period, the violating content will be permanently deleted.

## Repeat Infringers

   Forest will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate user accounts that are deemed to be repeat infringers.

## Reservation of Rights

   Forest reserves the right to remove or disable access to any content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion.
