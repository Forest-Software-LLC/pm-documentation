# Privacy Policy
**Effective Date:** 9/30/2025

Forest Software, LLC ("Forest Software", "we", "our", or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our developer tools, including the Forest Software CLI and any future components such as the Forest Software Studio Plugin (collectively, the “Services”).

By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect
We may collect the following categories of information:

- **Account Information**: email, username, hashed password.
- **Authentication Data**: OAuth tokens or API keys (encrypted at rest).
- **Usage Data**: anonymized analytics, package metadata (names, descriptions, README files), and logs of CLI/Service activity.
- **Organization Data**: private audit logs tied to your organization’s account.
- **Payment Information**: billing details processed securely by third-party payment providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). We do not store full credit card numbers.
- **Content Data**: code, packages, or assets you upload to share.

## How We Use Information
We use collected information to:

- Provide, operate, and improve the Services.
- Authenticate users and secure accounts.
- Process payments for subscriptions and purchases.
- Improve discovery and recommendations (e.g., AI analysis of public package metadata).
- Maintain organizational audit logs.
- Detect, prevent, and respond to abuse or legal obligations (e.g., DMCA requests).

## Sharing of Information
We do not sell personal information.

We may share limited data with:

- **Vendors/Service Providers**: such as hosting (e.g., AWS), payment processors (e.g., Stripe), analytics providers, and AI providers (e.g., OpenAI for metadata processing of public packages).
- **Legal/Compliance**: if required by law, court order, or to respond to copyright infringement notices.
- **Business Transfers**: if Forest Software is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.

## Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information, including:

- Encryption in transit (TLS).
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data such as OAuth tokens.
- Industry-standard password hashing for account credentials.

No system is perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

## Data Retention
- **Accounts**: retained until you request deletion.
- **Audit Logs**: retained for as long as your organization account is active, or as required by law.
- **Credentials**: removed upon account deletion.
- **Packages**: may persist unless removed by the package author.


We process and retain limited identifiers (e.g., public username in package metadata) under GDPR Art. 6(1)(f) legitimate interests, to ensure package integrity and dependency resolution.

We may retain certain data as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or for dispute resolution.

## Your Privacy Rights
- **GDPR (EU/EEA Users):** You have the right to request access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, data portability, and to object to certain processing. You may also lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
- **CCPA/CPRA (California Users):** You have the right to request to know what personal information we collect, to request deletion, and to opt-out of any sale or sharing of personal information. We do not sell personal information.

To exercise these rights, contact us at legal@forest.dev. We may require verification of your identity before fulfilling your request.

## Children’s Privacy
The Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. Users between 13–18 must have parental or guardian consent.

## International Users
Your information may be stored and processed in the United States. By using the Services, you consent to this transfer. If you are located outside the U.S., note that your data may be subject to U.S. laws.

## Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will notify you by email or within the Services. Continued use after changes take effect means you accept the updated policy.
