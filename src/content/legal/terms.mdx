# Terms of Service

These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of developer tools provided by Forest Software, LLC ("Forest Software", "we", "our", or "us").



## 1. Eligibility

You must be at least **13 years old** to use the Service. If you are using the service on behalf a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.


## 2. Accounts & Security

You may need an account to use some features. You’re responsible for keeping your credentials confidential and for actions taken using your account. You must provide accurate information and keep it current. We may require email verification or multi‑factor authentication.


## 3. Software License (CLI & Plugin)

Subject to these Terms, Forest Software grants you a limited, revocable, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to install and use the CLI and plugin solely to build with and for the Service. You may not: (a) copy, modify, or create derivative works of the software; (b) reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code except where permitted by law; (c) bypass, remove, or circumvent any security or technical measures; (d) resell, rent, or lease the Service unless we give you written permission.


## 4. Third‑Party Services & APIs

The Service may interact with third‑party platforms and APIs (e.g., **Roblox**). You are solely responsible for compliance with any third‑party terms, policies, and developer rules. We are not affiliated with or endorsed by such third parties, and we make no warranties about their services. We may disable integrations that violate third‑party terms or legal requirements.


## 5. User Content

**Ownership.** You retain ownership of code, assets, and other content you submit or upload through the Service (“User Content”).  

**License to Us.** You grant Forest Software a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to host, store, process, transmit, and display your User Content **solely to provide and operate** the Service and as you otherwise instruct (e.g., sharing or distribution features you use).

**Your Responsibilities.** You are responsible for your User Content and for ensuring you have the rights to submit it. Do not upload content that is illegal or that infringes others’ rights.  

**Visibility & Org Access.** If you use an organization account, designated org admins may access audit logs and certain usage information associated with your account as described in our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy).

**Atribution & Public Record.** When you upload or publish a package, your username becomes part of the permanent public record for that package. This information may continue to be displayed and retained even if your account is later deleted, as it is necessary for the integrity, attribution, and traceability of the software ecosystem.

## 5.1 Use of AI Services

We use third-party AI providers (such as OpenAI) to process package metadata, including but not limited to package names, descriptions, and README files. This processing is done only for public packages and is used to improve search, discovery, and recommendations within Forest Software. By uploading a public package, you grant Forest Software a non-exclusive, worldwide license to analyze and process its metadata for these purposes. This license is limited to enabling functionality within Forest Software and does not authorize us or our AI providers to redistribute or commercialize your content beyond what is necessary to provide the service. You are responsible for ensuring that your submissions (including README and metadata) do not infringe on third-party rights, contain sensitive personal information, or otherwise violate applicable laws or these Terms. Private packages are never sent to external AI providers.


## 6. Acceptable Use

You agree not to misuse the Service. For example, you will not: (a) violate laws or third‑party rights; (b) attempt to gain unauthorized access to accounts, systems, or data; (c) interfere with the Service’s operation; (d) deploy malware, spam, or automated abuse; (e) use the Service for exploitation or harassment; (f) circumvent rate limits; (g) engage in high‑risk activities where failure could lead to death or injury. We may investigate and suspend accounts for suspected violations.


## 7. Moderation & Reporting

We **do not pre-screen** User Content before it is made available. Instead, we provide community reporting tools — including a form to report packages — and may use automated filters to flag obvious abuse.

We may remove or disable access to any content, or suspend or terminate accounts, where we in good faith believe these Terms, our Acceptable Use Policy, or applicable law are violated (including repeat infringement under Section 9).

We are **not obligated to monitor all content** and make no guarantees that all objectionable or unlawful content will be removed. Users are encouraged to use the reporting tools to help us maintain a safe and compliant environment.


## 8. Fees and Payment

You agree to pay all fees associated with your subscription or purchase in accordance with the pricing and billing terms presented to you at the time of purchase.

**All payments are non-refundable and non-transferable**, except as required by applicable law. This includes, without limitation, situations where you cancel your subscription before the end of a billing period.

Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel before the renewal date. You may cancel at any time, but cancellation will only prevent future charges; you will not receive a refund for amounts already paid.

We reserve the right to modify pricing or billing terms with reasonable advance notice to you (typically by email or within the Service). Continued use of the Service after such notice constitutes your agreement to the updated terms.


## 9. Copyright & IP Infringement (DMCA)

Use of Forest Software trademarks, logos, or other brand assets requires prior written permission from Forest Software.

Feedback is voluntary; we may use it without restriction.


## 11. Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access immediately if you materially breach these Terms, create risk or possible legal exposure for us, or use the Service in a way that could disrupt others. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends, but Sections 5–5.1, 8–10, and 12–16 (including any limited licenses needed to operate the Service, e.g., backups) will survive termination.


## 12. Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** AND **“AS AVAILABLE.”** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free, or that content will be preserved without loss.


## 13. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, Forest Software AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF **(A) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM** OR **(B) US $100.** Some jurisdictions don’t allow certain limits; these may not apply to you.


## 14. Indemnity

You will indemnify and hold Forest Software harmless from any claim arising from your use of the Service or User Content that violates law or third‑party rights.


## 15. Export & Sanctions

You may not use the Service if you are located in, or are a resident of, a country or region embargoed by the U.S., or if you are on any U.S. government list of restricted parties. You agree to comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws.


## 16. Disputes; Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules.  

You and Forest Software consent to Travis County, Texas as the exclusive venue for any permitted court proceedings.  


## 17. Changes to the Service or Terms

We may modify the Service and these Terms. For material changes, we will provide notice (e.g., email or in‑app) and the changes will take effect prospectively. If you continue using the Service after the effective date, you accept the changes.
